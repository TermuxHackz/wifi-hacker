#   VERSION HISTORY BEGIN   ################################################
############################################################################

# v2.0
# - Added support for new Gnome terminal options. Tested in Kali 2018.4

# v1.9
# - Added support for Wash. Currently used for dumping scan info out to text.
# - Added "Bruteforce Hidden SSID Options" To Extras Menu and updated bruteforceHiddenSSID() Function.
# - Updated Menu Navigation to restrict from entering Extras Menu until after a wireless adapter has been selected.
# - Configured updates with new coloring, and now will only update if remote version is higher than local version.
# - Cleaned up code for doSleepMessage() Function. Now takes 3 arguments, "message", "time", and "color".
# - Updated Extras Menu. Added wpa_supplicant enable and disable options. Updated wpa_cli options.
# - Updated Reaver save session to only save a backup if current session file exists.
# - Fixed and updated Reaver output post screen that was broken in the last release version.

# v1.8
# - Cleaned up scripting and moved all global hotkey triggers to a loadMenuHotkeys Function.
# - Added a bruteforceHiddenSSID() Function to handle hidden SSID name reveals.
# - Added logging to XML file from airodump-ng when scanning Access Points for all encryption types.
# - Added automatic 10 second timeout for Update Menu to continue to main menu for attacking.
# - Fixed Update Menu. "Check For Update" and "Apply New Update" are now functional.
# - Update Menu now loads automatically after accepting license agreement.
# - Added support for parsing network adapter names for displaying when selecting adapter to use.
# - Added a check for PixieWPS attacks. If failed, will now default to normal Reaver attack.

# v1.7
# - Currently supports up to 10 wifi adapters.
# - Changed hotkey for "Manual Adapter Entry" from "M" to "C", because of conflicting with main menu hotkey
# - Added adapter check after disclaimer is agreed, so the main menu will show the correct number of adapters.
# - Updated "killCounterMax" to use "interfacesFound" value for "stopMonitorMode()" function

# v1.6
# - Added a "forceDisconnectWiFi" function to help fix active internet connection issues.
# - Changed the handling of "WiFi Force Disconnect". Now, after accepting the agreement, the main menu will only load if the connection status is "0". If the status is "1", meaning the WiFi is connected to an access point, the "forceDisconnectWiFi" and "checkNetworkStatus" functions are called until the connection is released. This allows for better control of correcting errors resulting in having an active network connection.
# - Added "ifconfig" and "iwconfig" output to Extras Interface Menu
# - Merged "checkForEmptyBSSID", "checkForEmptyESSID", and "checkForEmptyChannel" into "checkForEmptyCredentials" function.

# v1.3
# - Added support for AirCrack Suite v1.2+ using the new wlanXmon format instead of monX.
# - Fixed "wlanXmon" error in Kali Linux 2.x caused by new AirCrack Suite 1.2+. See "fixKaliTwoMonError" function for more info.
# - Added a function to check the Linux version running.
# - Removed Honeypot Mode from the banners. It has been relocated to the Advanced Menu.
# - Added "$interfaceName" and "$interfaceMode" variables.
# - Added interfaceName to the stats banner. This will display the current interface name (wlan0, mon0, wlan0mon, etc).
# - Added interfaceMode to the main banner. Valid Interface Modes are 0=Managed / 1=Monitor Standard / 2=Monitor New / 3=Monitor Other / 4=Unknown
# - Added "Open Interface Options" item to Extras Menu.
# - Added "Interface Up", "Interface Down", "Interface Managed", and "Interface Monitor" to Extras Menu. The Up and Down functions affect the interface ONLY for monitor mode (mon0, mon1, wlan0mon, wlan1mon, etc) currently. Please use Enable/Disable Channel Hopping to bring up/down a managed interface (i.e. wlan0, wlan1, etc).
# - Added support for all new Reaver arguments and options for Kali 2.x build.

# - Added "isDebugMode" variable to show/hide certain areas that may need additional testing output. Disabled by default.
# - Fixed default WEP dump scanning channel hopping during attack.

# v1.2
# - Fixed the top text of disclaimer banner from being cut off.

# v1.1
# - Now globally enforcing disconnection from any active network upon agreement of disclaimer to resolve "Channel Hopping" issues. This must be done for all attacks to work properly.
# - Added "HoneyPot Mode" to main toolbar. The hotkey is "Z" to launch from anywhere in script. There is currently support for airbase-ng and wifi-honey.
# - Fixed "Negative One Channel Error" occuring in airodump-ng on Kali Linux 1.0.6 and higher. This is fixed globally and should work on all platforms.
# - Added "Start NetworkManager", "Stop NetworkManager", "Stop wpa_supplicant", "Stop wpa_cli", "Enable Channel Hopping", and "Disable Channel Hopping" to Extras menu.
# - Enabled the Advanced Menu. Also enabled the hotkey "A" to launch it. Future releases will contain highly configurable settings for supported apps and modules.
# - Added support for nmap and netcat, for use during post exploitation.
# - Fixed some $bssid and $essid variable errors in WEP attacks. 
# - Fixed airodump window not closing if using load session hotkey during victim info, and then returning to the post monitor mode menu.
# - Fixed a bug where the post monitor mode screen would still load if no encryption type was selected. If the encryption type is empty, it will now return to the main menu.
# - Updated on-screen instructions for using the airdump windows and other terminal windows that are opened during target/victim setup.
# - Fixed network connection not refreshing the correct status when returning to the main menu if the network status has changed while still on the menu.

# - Moved autoMode text towards the top of the post monitor mode initiation screen to be more easily visible to the user.
# - Added support for post-exploitation attacks after a target has been compromised.
# - Added support for "wifite". This is used for some of the newer automated attack modes as well as an alternate option to aircrack-suite if desired.
# - Added Auto Attack Mode to the main menu. This option uses wifite to scan and attack any vulnerable network.
# - Changed some text around on some items to be more clear and understandable.
# - Added Auto modes for each attack type when selected. Once an encryption type is selected, you can type "autowep, autowps, autowpa, and autowpa2 respectively to automate the attack.
# - Fixed a few $lastMenuID variables not properly set for menu navigation.
# - Added a wifite window alongside the aircrack window when selecting WPS attacks, to help decipher which targets support WPS more easily.

# v1.0
# - Activated the disclaimer when launching the script to make sure everyone knows the rules ;)
# - Added "checkRootStatus" to verify elevated privileges before launching main menu.
# - Fixed a few typos throughout the script.
# - Added Connection display to main menu. A status of "0" is disconnected and "1" is connected.
# - Added connection status check before allowing an attack mode to be selected. This prevents trying to start an attack and being locked into a channel and other abnormalities.
# - Added text display variables for connection status. They can be displayed as "None" or "Wifi", depending on if connection status is 0 or 1.

# v0.9
# - Removed the writeDCrackPy() function. This was used to write the Python script dcrack.py out to a file.

# v0.6
# - Added time and date stamp to all $encryptionType.sessions log files.
# - The "Clean Capture Files" option now only removes files in the init directory, not sessions directory.
# - Fixed bug not returning back to Extras menu after selected task has been completed.
# - All created files will now be saved to the "/sessions/$encryptionType" directory by default.
# - Added getCurrentDate() and getCurrentTime() functions to use with sessions and backups.
